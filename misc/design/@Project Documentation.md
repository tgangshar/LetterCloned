# Security Documentation
	Test Case

	- Shift Left security
	- Zero Trust?
	- PennTesting
	- Networking
	- AppSec
# Overview 
	Context building
- Push to production as soon asap 
- For Product Documentation we can adapt some of Letterboxd 
	- Features and properties shouldn't change that much
	- UX should be similar as well
	- Architecture needs to change based on our new technology
	- We are unaware their test cases; we will have to research more on this
- We should focus on the Strategy Roadmap; as a general roadmap
	- Strategy roadmap should first start with the other documentation and roadmaps
	- We should set this after the architecture doc
	- We should finish this at the end for advance features
	- I might need help for this especially since it might help test
	- We need more research for this
- We are not adopting full agile principles and will cut corners in places such as metrics.
	- We want to practice secure code by design or shift left security
	- Maybe some DevSecOps
